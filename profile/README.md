# Blupp Co

## About us
We are a technology company with the team size of 2 and enough skillset to make a team of 20 feel shy.

We love to code and consider excess taking a wastage of time. We refrain from getting on too many calls and focus on dealing with async work.

## Problem
- Currently the internet is filled with bloated technologies like Wordpress making the user experience slow.
- Companies invest heavily on design and development to get the first version live but second or third versions never go live, due to costing.
- Even maintaining plugins and servers become a hassle.
- Even the core team developers do not care much about the existing stack. They don't wish to get into updating wordpress versions or NextJS packages as well.
- Managing company is a hassle. When your job is to make money, you should focus purely on clients.

## Solution
- We manage everything for you. Everything from codebase, servers, CDNs and your content.
- If you wish to own the codebase and have extra control, you just have to pay extra.
- We choose the technology stack and keep it updated on a weekly basis.
- We only deliver in performance and speed.

## Services
- Website.
- Dynamic website. (we do not recomment it due to reasons above. If you still want it, we fully support you.)
- Backend APIs.
- Backend micro services API.
- Blogs (Majorly depends on the frequency of posting. In most cases, you wish to have it but this lasts only for a few weeks. We do not recomment it due to reasons above. If you still want it, we fully support you.)

## Pricing
- We work on a monthly retainer and charge as per the requirement, but it's a promise that it's much cheaper from the market. We would normally allow 3 changes per month which are not design changes or major structural changes and post that, it becomes â‚¹/3 changes.
- We might charge one time development cost and usally deliver the website in a week's time. The suppostion is the design is finalised and there's no to and fro.
- If we get on a call, we charge for the call.

## What we don't do
- Design.
- Wordpress.
- SEO.
