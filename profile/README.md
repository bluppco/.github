# Blupp Co

## About us
We are a technology company with the team size of 2 and enough skillset to make a team of 20 feel shy.

We love to code and consider excess taking a wastage of time. We refrain from getting on too many calls and focus on dealing with async work.

## Problem
- Currently the internet is filled with bloated technologies like Wordpress making the user experience slow.
- So much of internet bandwidth is wasted on unoptimised codebase, images and assets.
- Companies invest heavily on design and development to get the first version live but second or third versions never go live, due to costing.
- Maintaining plugins and servers become a hassle.
- The core team developers do not care much about the existing stack. They don't wish to get into updating wordpress versions or NextJS packages as well. They focus on new work.
- When your job is to make money, not focus on your website.

## Solution
- We manage everything for you. Everything from codebase, servers, CDNs and your content.
- If you wish to own the codebase and have extra control, you just have to pay extra.
- We choose the technology stack and keep it updated on a weekly basis.
- We only deliver in performance and speed.

## Services
- Website.
- Dynamic website. (we do not recommend it due to reasons above. If you still want it, we fully support you.)
- Backend APIs.
- Backend micro services API.
- Blogs - Majorly depends on the frequency of posting. In most cases, you wish to have it but this lasts only for a few weeks. We do not recommend it due to reasons above. If you still want it, we fully support you.

## Pricing
- We work on a monthly retainer and charge as per the requirement, but it's a promise that it's much cheaper from the market. We would normally allow 3 changes per month which are not design changes or major structural changes and post that, it becomes â‚¹/3 changes.
- We might charge one time development cost and usally deliver the website in a week's time. The suppostion is the design is finalised and there's no to and fro.
- If we get on a call, we charge for the call.

## What we don't do
- Design.
- Wordpress.
- SEO.
